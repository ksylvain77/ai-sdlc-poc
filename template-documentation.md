# AI SDLC Inception Template â€“ Documentation

## Purpose & Vision

Transform ideas into ready-to-build software projects through structured AI contracts. Users copy this template to start new projects, then execute two AI contracts (Discovery + Framework) to go from "I have an idea" to "I'm ready to build" with a complete project scaffold.

## How It Works

This template doesn't use specific libraries â€“ the AI executing the contracts generates appropriate technology stacks based on requirements. Proven to work with Node.js/Express, Java/Kafka/Kubernetes, React Native, and other stacks as determined by the AI during contract execution.

## Folder Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ discovery_contract.md      # Requirements gathering contract
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ framework_contract.md      # Architecture selection contract
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements/                  # (empty - populated during contract execution)

## Real End-User Workflow

1. Copy template to new repository
2. Execute discovery_contract.md with AI
3. Execute framework_contract.md with AI
4. Get generated requirements and project scaffold
5. Begin development with clear foundation

## Template Testing Process

For template refinement only (not end-user workflow):

- Execute contracts collaboratively with human as intermediary
- Human takes contract questions to ChatGPT (acting as persona proxy for real users)
- ChatGPT responds as assigned persona to simulate real user behavior
- Human brings persona responses back for contract continuation
- Complete contract execution and create deliverables in workspace
- This process validates contract improvements before release

## Project Phases

Following 3-phase development approach:

- **Discovery**: Requirements gathering contract âœ…
- **Framework**: Architecture selection contract âœ…
- **Refinement**: Contract improvements based on feedback ðŸš§

## Success Metrics

- Contract reliability across complexity levels
- Quality of generated requirements and scaffolds
- User success rate from idea to buildable project
- Template adoption and reuse effectiveness

## Contract Testing Examples

Validated against:

- Simple projects (bill reminder, task manager)
- Complex enterprise systems (unified customer platform)
- Mobile applications
- API-first architectures
- Microservices implementations

## Feedback Integration

Template improvements based on real usage:

- Business user feedback on requirements clarity
- Technical user feedback on architecture decisions
- Process feedback on contract execution flow
- Output quality feedback on generated deliverables
