## Framework Contract Feedback (use N/A if not tested)

### Architecture Selection

- **Made sense for the requirements?** [Yes/No - explain]
- **Options seemed realistic?** [Yes/No - were alternatives plausible?]
- **Selection rationale clear?** [Yes/No - did you understand why X was chosen?]

### Scaffolding Output

- **Complete enough?** [Yes/No - what was missing?]
- **Actually usable?** [Yes/No - could you start coding from this?]
- **ADRs helpful?** [Yes/No - did decision records make sense?]

### Integration and Ecosystem Fit

- **System integration addressed?** [Were integration needs with existing tools/systems adequately explored?]
- **Ecosystem compatibility?** [Did the solution fit your existing technology ecosystem?]
- **Migration path?** [Was the transition from current state to new solution addressed?]

## Overall Assessment

### What Worked Well

- [List 2-3 things that felt effective]

### Major Issues

- [List 2-3 problems that would prevent real use]

### Process Efficiency

- **Frustration points?** [What moments made you want to quit or skip ahead?]

- **Would you actually implement this solution?** [Yes/No - why not?]

## Recommendations

- **Immediate fixes needed**: [Critical changes to make contracts usable]
- **Enhancements for next version**: [Nice-to-have improvements]
- **Different personas to test**: [What other user types should we try?]

## Feedback Template Assessment

### Template Usability

- **Easy to fill out?** [Yes/No - which sections were confusing or unclear?]
- **Right level of detail?** [Too detailed/Too shallow/Just right]
- **Missing questions?** [What should this template ask that it doesn't?]
- **Redundant questions?** [Any questions that felt repetitive or unnecessary?]

### Template Completeness

- **Captured your experience adequately?** [Yes/No - what aspects of testing weren't covered?]
- **Appropriate structure?** [Did the sections flow logically?]
- **Time to complete?** [How long did filling this out take? Reasonable?]

## Overall Rating

- **Discovery Contract**: [1-5 stars or N/A] - [one sentence why]
- **Framework Contract**: [1-5 stars or N/A] - [one sentence why]
- **Would recommend to others**: [Yes/No] - [brief reason]
