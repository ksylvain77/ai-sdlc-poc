## Step 1: Problem & Project Identity

**AI:** I'm excited to help you figure this out! What's the main thing that's bugging you that you'd like to solve?

**Persona:** Uh… I'm not really sure how to answer that exactly. I mean, something's bugging me, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

Maybe it's like… I want something that helps me keep track of stuff better? Or… actually, wait, maybe that's not it. It could be more about, like, communication? I don't know.

What kinds of things can you fix?

**AI:** That's totally okay - sometimes the best solutions come from that feeling that something's just not quite right!

You mentioned keeping track of stuff and maybe communication - those are great starting points. Let me ask this: when you go through your day, what moment makes you think "ugh, this is annoying" or "there has to be a better way"?

It could be anything - something that takes too long, something you forget, something that feels messy or confusing. What's that moment for you?

**Persona:** Hmm… well… I guess sometimes I'll write something down somewhere, like a note or maybe in my phone, and then later I can't remember where I put it. Or I'll tell myself "I'll remember this," and then… I don't.

But also, sometimes people ask me questions and I think I already told them, or maybe I didn't? It all kind of blurs together.

Actually, wait… maybe that's two different problems. Or maybe it's the same? I don't know. Does that make sense?

**AI:** That makes perfect sense! You're dealing with that frustrating thing where information just... disappears into the void, right? Both your own notes vanishing and conversations getting fuzzy.

It sounds like you want some kind of system that keeps everything in one place so you don't lose track - would you call this maybe a "Personal Memory Helper" or "Everything Tracker"? What would you call it if you had to explain it to a friend - like "I need this thing that..."?

**Persona:** I think I'd probably just say something like, "I need something that remembers for me."

Not like… a complicated system or anything, just a place where I can dump stuff and know it won't get lost.

Or maybe like, "a brain outside my brain"? That sounds kinda silly though.

Would it be like… an app? Or a notebook? Or… actually, wait—could it be both?

**AI:** "A brain outside my brain" - I love that! That's not silly at all, it's actually perfect. And "something that remembers for me" really captures what you need.

So let's call this your "External Brain" project for now - that feels right, doesn't it?

---

## Step 2: Current State & Context

**AI:** Now help me understand how you're handling this today - what's your current reality? Like, where do you put things now when you want to remember them, and what happens that makes it frustrating?

**Persona:** Uh… well, right now it's kinda all over the place. Sometimes I jot something on a sticky note, sometimes I put it in my phone's notes app, and other times I just… keep it in my head and hope I remember.

The problem is, later I don't know where I put it. Like, did I write it on paper? Did I put it in my phone? Or did I never actually write it down at all? Then I waste time hunting, or I just give up.

So yeah, I guess the "system" is… no real system. Just scattered pieces everywhere.

**AI:** That scattered feeling is so frustrating! It's like having puzzle pieces in different rooms and never being able to put the picture together.

What made you start thinking about fixing this now? Was there a specific moment recently where something got lost and you thought "okay, this has to stop," or has it just been building up over time?

**Persona:** Hmm… I think it's kinda been building up, but there was this one time recently—I was supposed to call someone back, I had their number written down somewhere, and when I went to find it, it was just… gone.

I checked my desk, my phone, even old texts, but nope. I ended up having to ask someone else for the number again, which was kind of embarrassing.

So yeah… that was one of those "ugh, I can't keep doing this" moments.

**AI:** Oh, that's the worst - having to ask for something you know you wrote down! That embarrassment really hits home why this matters.

Who else deals with this kind of thing in your world? Like, is this just your personal headache, or do other people - family, friends, coworkers - get impacted when your information goes missing too?

**Persona:** Yeah… it's mostly my headache, but it definitely spills over. Like, if I forget something at work, then a coworker has to remind me or we waste time re-doing something. And with family, if I forget plans or details, they get annoyed or think I wasn't paying attention.

So it's not just me—it kind of makes them frustrated too. Which makes me feel worse, like I let people down.

Actually, wait… now that I'm saying it out loud, maybe that's the bigger problem. Not just me forgetting, but how it affects everyone else too.

---

## Step 3: Data Flow, Volume & Existing Systems

**AI:** That's such an important insight - it's not just about your memory, it's about the ripple effect on relationships and how it makes you feel when you let people down.

So for your External Brain project, help me understand what information flows through your world. What kinds of things are you trying to keep track of? Like, what goes into your brain that you need to remember later?

**Persona:** Um… let me think… it's kind of a mix of stuff:

    People's phone numbers or little details they tell me.

    Things I'm supposed to do—like errands, follow-ups, or random "don't forget" tasks.

    Dates and times, but not just big ones—like small appointments or when I promised to call someone.

    Ideas I get in the moment that I think I'll remember later (but don't).

    Oh, and passwords… but I know those are supposed to go somewhere "secure," so maybe that's different.

Actually, wait… maybe it's anything that pops into my head that feels important in the moment, but it slips away if I don't catch it.

**AI:** That's a really good way to put it - "anything that pops into my head that feels important in the moment." It sounds like you're dealing with this constant stream of little bits of information throughout your day.

How much of this stuff happens in a typical day or week? Like, are we talking about a few things here and there, or is it more like a constant flow of details you're trying to catch?

**Persona:** It's more like a constant flow. Some days it's just a couple little things, but other days it feels like I'm juggling a dozen bits and pieces.

By the end of the week, I probably have… I don't know, twenty or thirty things floating around? Maybe more, if I'm honest.

Actually—wait, that sounds like a lot when I say it out loud. No wonder I can't keep track.

**AI:** Twenty to thirty things a week - yeah, that IS a lot! No wonder your brain feels overloaded. That's like trying to hold a handful of marbles without dropping any.

What tools do you already have that we'd need to work with? Like, do you want this External Brain to play nice with your phone, your computer, or any apps you already use? Or are you starting totally fresh?

**Persona:** Hmm… well, I mostly use my phone for quick stuff, since it's always with me. I have a computer, but that's more for when I'm sitting down at a desk.

I do use the Notes app sometimes, and reminders, but… I kinda forget to look at them. So they don't really help unless I remember to check.

So maybe it should work with my phone for sure. But… actually, I don't know—should it also be on my computer? Or would that just make it more confusing?

---

## Step 4: Success Definition

**AI:** That's a great question about whether it should be everywhere or just one place!

So for your External Brain, what does success look like? How will you know this thing is actually working the way you want it to? Like, what would your day feel like when this is working right?

**Persona:** I think it would feel… calmer. Like I wouldn't be carrying all this mental weight around, trying not to forget things.

If I could just trust that everything I need is in one place, and I can find it fast, that would be success.

So instead of panicking—"where's that number?" or "what was I supposed to do?"—I'd just open my External Brain and… there it is.

Actually, yeah—success would feel like my brain can finally relax.

---

## Step 5: User Identification

**AI:** "My brain can finally relax" - that's beautiful! That feeling of calm and trust instead of panic and mental weight.

Who's going to use this day-to-day? Is this just for you, or would other people - like family or coworkers - need to add things or look things up too? What are you all trying to get done with it?

**Persona:** Mostly it's just for me, I think. Like, I'm the one who needs the brain-help the most.

But… maybe it could be useful if family could add things too? Like if someone says, "don't forget this," they could just put it straight in there instead of relying on me.

At work, though… hmm, I'm not sure. It might get messy if coworkers added stuff too. So maybe personal use first, and later I could see if sharing makes sense.

So yeah—for now, mainly me. Just trying to not drop the ball on life's little (and not-so-little) things.

---

## Step 6: Failure Scenarios

**AI:** That makes sense - start with your own brain relief, then maybe expand to family later if it helps.

What would make this project a disaster for you? Like, what are you most worried about going wrong? What would make you think "ugh, this is worse than my scattered sticky notes"?

**Persona:** Oh, that's easy—if it turned into another thing to keep track of. Like, if I had to remember complicated steps just to use it, that would be worse.

Or if it ended up as clutter—like I'd put stuff in, but then never find it again because it got buried. That'd feel just as bad as losing sticky notes.

Actually, wait—also if it didn't stick. Like if I tried it for a week and then stopped using it, then it's just another abandoned app on my phone.

---

## Step 7: Timeline & Urgency

**AI:** Those are really smart worries - you don't want to trade one problem for three new ones! Complicated steps, digital clutter, and another abandoned app would definitely be worse.

Are you dealing with any deadlines or timing pressures around this? Like, do you need to get this figured out soon, or is this more of a "when I get around to it" kind of thing?

**Persona:** It's not like there's a hard deadline, but… every time I lose something important, it feels urgent in that moment.

So I guess it's more of a "the sooner the better" thing. I don't want to keep having those little crises.

But no one's breathing down my neck about it—it's just me wanting to finally get a handle on it.

---

## Step 8: Budget & Resources

**AI:** That makes total sense - not urgent urgent, but those little crises add up and you're ready to stop having them.

What's your budget reality for this? Are we talking about something free, or do you have some money you could put toward an app or tool if it really solved the problem?

**Persona:** Honestly… I'd love it if it were free. But if it actually worked—like really solved the problem—I could probably justify spending a little each month.

Not a huge amount, though. Like, if it started creeping up into "subscription overload" territory, I'd probably bail.

So yeah… free would be ideal, cheap-but-worth-it could work too.

---

## Step 9: Project Risks

**AI:** Free is always nice, and a little monthly cost for something that actually works sounds reasonable.

What could kill this project for you? What are the biggest risks or obstacles that might make you give up on the whole External Brain idea?

**Persona:** Hmm… I think the biggest risk is me just… not sticking with it. Like, if it feels like effort, I'll slip back into my old habits.

Also, if it's too fiddly—like too many buttons or settings—I'll get overwhelmed and drop it.

Oh, and if it doesn't actually help right away. If I don't see the benefit quickly, I'll probably lose interest before it has a chance to work.

So yeah—the danger is me giving up because it's confusing, complicated, or slow to feel useful.

---

## Step 10: Success Metrics

**AI:** Those are really honest insights about yourself - and actually super useful for figuring out what this needs to be like!

How will you know if this External Brain is actually working? What signs or changes would tell you "yes, this is making my life better"?

**Persona:** I think I'll know it's working if…

    I stop losing things I wrote down.

    People stop having to remind me of stuff I already promised.

    I feel less of that "oh no, I forgot" panic.

    And maybe… I don't have random sticky notes everywhere anymore.

Basically, if life feels smoother and I can trust myself more, that would be the sign it's actually helping.

---

## Step 11: Cost of Inaction

**AI:** Those are perfect success signs - less panic, more trust in yourself, and people not having to be your backup memory!

What happens if you don't tackle this External Brain project? What's the cost of just keeping things the way they are now with your scattered system?

**Persona:** If I don't fix it… then it's just more of the same—missed things, wasted time hunting for notes, feeling embarrassed when I forget stuff, and stressing myself out.

And honestly, that "mental load" thing… it's exhausting. Like my brain's always buzzing, trying not to drop anything.

So the cost is basically staying stressed and scattered. And probably letting people down again, which I really don't want.

---

## Step 12: Decision Confidence

**AI:** That mental load buzzing is so exhausting - and the fear of letting people down really adds weight to it.

What would make you confident this External Brain is the right solution? What would need to be true for you to feel good about moving forward with it?

**Persona:** I think I'd feel confident if it was:

    Really simple — like I can add something in two seconds without thinking.

    Reliable — I know it'll still be there when I need it, not disappear or get lost in menus.

    Easy to check — one place I can look and instantly see what I need.

    Feels natural — not like a chore, more like a habit that just fits into my day.

If those things were true, I'd feel good about trusting it. Actually, I'd probably feel relieved.

---

## Step 13: Missing Elements

**AI:** Simple, reliable, easy to check, and feels natural - those are really clear requirements that would definitely give you that relief!

Last question - what haven't I asked that you think is important for understanding this External Brain project? Anything else that would matter for making this work for you?

**Persona:** Hmm… maybe just that it shouldn't feel too formal. Like, I don't want it to be some big structured system where I have to categorize everything perfectly.

Sometimes I just want to jot something quick and messy, and then later I can figure it out. If it forces me to be super organized from the start, I'll probably resist using it.

So yeah—I guess it needs to handle both: messy brain-dumps and organized stuff, without making me choose upfront.

---

## Session End

**AI:** Perfect - I've captured everything I need to understand your External Brain project. You want something that lets your brain finally relax by giving you a simple, reliable place to dump information without forcing perfect organization upfront.
