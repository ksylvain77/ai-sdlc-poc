## Step 1: Problem & Project Identity

**AI:** I'm excited to help you figure this out! What's the main thing that's bugging you that you'd like to solve?

**Persona:** If we're going deep right away—biggest pain point I've seen is systems that don't respect proper OAuth 2.0 flows. Too often someone sets up "basic auth with a token," and then we hit a wall once we need PKCE for mobile clients or delegated scopes for third-party integrations.

That's the core bugbear: I don't want a system that paints us into a corner because it didn't implement the standard correctly.

What about you—are you asking me about technical blockers like this, or more about workflow pain points I want solved first?

**AI:** I love that you're thinking about solutions! But first, what problem is that solving?

It sounds like you've been hit by authentication headaches before - what's the main thing that's bugging you that you'd like to solve? Are you dealing with a specific project where this OAuth stuff is becoming a blocker, or is this more about preventing future pain?

**Persona:** Yeah, it's very much a current pain, not just theory.

We've got a distributed app—browser clients, a couple of mobile apps, and some backend microservices that need to talk to each other. Right now, the "auth" layer is half-baked: some parts use a static bearer token, some have homegrown cookie sessions, and none of it lines up cleanly.

The real headache: trying to onboard new integrations. We had a partner system that required proper OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, and we had to build a messy adapter just to fake it. That's brittle, insecure, and slows us down every time we want to add a new client or external system.

So the problem I want to solve is: a clean, standard-compliant authentication/authorization foundation that works across clients, scales to more partners, and doesn't force us to keep patching holes.

Do you want me to break down where this bites us most today—like developer productivity, security risk, or partner onboarding friction?

**AI:** I'm hearing a lot of good stuff - can you help me boil it down to the main thing?

It sounds like this is about having a solid auth foundation that works everywhere - should we call it something like "Unified Auth Platform" for now, or what would you call this thing if you had to describe it to a friend?

**Persona:** If I had to strip it down and name it in plain English, I'd call it "One Login, Everywhere."

That's basically what I want: a unified, standards-based authentication system that every app, service, and partner can rely on—no more hacks, no more exceptions.

"Unified Auth Platform" works fine as a working title, but when I explain it to teammates or a friend, it's just "we stop juggling different logins and token schemes and move to one consistent, secure approach."

Want me to sketch the two or three biggest outcomes this would unlock, so we're clear on why it's worth investing in?

---

## Step 2: Current State & Context

**AI:** Moving to Step 2.

Help me understand how you're handling this today - what's your current reality?

**Persona:** Current state is a patchwork, honestly:

    Web app → still using old cookie-based sessions tied to our legacy backend.

    Mobile apps → hacked together with static bearer tokens. Those tokens don't expire properly, so revoking access is a nightmare.

    Microservices → some call each other with internal service accounts, others just pass the same shared token around. Totally inconsistent.

    Partner integrations → every time we connect to a new partner, we write one-off adapters, because they expect real OAuth flows we don't support natively.

Net result: developers waste time building workarounds, security posture is weak, and it's hard to explain to partners why our setup is so messy.

Do you want me to zoom in more on where it hurts most (developer time, partner trust, or security risk), or keep it broad for now?

**AI:** That's helpful context - what made you think about tackling this project now? Was there a specific breaking point or something you saw elsewhere that inspired this?

**Persona:** The breaking point was a partner integration earlier this year. They required OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and dynamic client registration, and we simply couldn't support it. We ended up hand-rolling an adapter layer that barely passed their compliance check, and it added weeks of delay.

That was the moment I realized we can't keep duct-taping auth. Every new partner or client app will force us through the same pain.

Also, our security team has been pushing harder lately—audits flagged the static bearer tokens as unacceptable. So between external partner demands and internal compliance pressure, it feels like the right (and necessary) time to fix this.

Want me to spell out what success would look like—like how we'd know the "One Login, Everywhere" vision is actually working?

**AI:** Who else is involved in this - like who would be impacted by changes or needs to sign off on this kind of project?

**Persona:** Quite a few groups get touched if we take this on:

    Developers → they're the ones wrestling with the current mess every day. They'll be the biggest beneficiaries if auth is standardized.

    Security team → they're already pushing us to tighten things up, so they'd need to sign off on whatever we implement.

    Product managers → they feel the pain indirectly when integrations get delayed or mobile users complain about login issues.

    Partners → external integrations absolutely depend on us supporting real standards. This project would directly improve their experience.

    Execs / compliance leads → because audits and customer trust are on the line, leadership will want to know we're fixing this gap.

So it's not just a dev project—it's got cross-team visibility.

Do you want me to prioritize which of these stakeholders would be the hardest to convince, versus which ones will be quick wins?

---

## Step 3: Data Flow, Volume & Existing Systems

**AI:** Moving to Step 3.

Help me understand what information flows through this - what are you working with?

**Persona:** At the core, it's identity and access information moving around:

    User identities → employee logins, customer accounts, partner accounts. Right now they're fragmented across systems.

    Access tokens / sessions → these grant apps and services permission to act on behalf of a user or system. Currently inconsistent in format and lifetime.

    Claims / roles → who the user is, what they're allowed to do, what tenant or region they belong to. This metadata is critical but scattered.

    Service-to-service credentials → machine identities for microservices, often just static keys that live too long.

So the "flows" are basically:

    User or service authenticates.

    Some token or session gets issued.

    That token carries identity/role claims and is passed around to authorize requests.

The pain today is that each environment (web, mobile, services, partners) has its own flavor of these flows—no unified model.

Would it help if I map out the riskiest of these flows right now, the ones most likely to cause a breach or failure?

**AI:** What kind of volume are we talking about - how much of this authentication stuff happens in a typical day or week?

**Persona:** On an average weekday we're handling thousands of auth events without realizing it. Rough ballpark:

    Web logins/sessions → a few hundred active users, generating maybe 2–3K login/session refreshes per day.

    Mobile apps → lighter user base but very chatty; tokens get reused constantly. Easily another few thousand auth calls daily.

    Microservice calls → this is the firehose. Services call each other constantly, and every call should be authorized. We're talking tens of thousands of token checks or credential handoffs each day.

    Partner integrations → smaller in raw numbers, but high-stakes. A single failed handshake can delay entire workflows for external teams.

So while the human logins number in the thousands, the system-to-system traffic is in the tens of thousands. That's why inconsistency in auth schemes is such a drag—it compounds fast at scale.

Do you want me to pin down the security exposure in numbers (like % of calls on static tokens vs. properly managed), or keep it more high-level?

**AI:** What existing tools or systems are you already using that we'd need to work with or around?

**Persona:** oday we've got a bit of a grab bag:

    Legacy identity → LDAP directory still powers some of the older internal apps.

    Cloud IdP → we use Azure AD for corporate logins (SSO into Office 365, a couple SaaS apps).

    Auth libraries → web stack uses Passport.js in Node, but configured inconsistently. Mobile has some custom token handling code.

    APIs / gateways → we've got an API gateway in place (Kong), but right now it mostly just routes traffic—it's not enforcing strong auth/authorization policies.

    Monitoring → SIEM (Splunk) is hooked up to logs, but because auth is fragmented, the visibility is poor.

So any solution has to bridge legacy LDAP, modern Azure AD, and the custom stuff our devs have bolted on.

Do you want me to flag which of these systems are deal-breakers we can't replace, versus which ones are more flexible to change?

---

## Step 4: Success Definition

**AI:** Moving to Step 4.

What does success look like for you - how will you know this is working the way you want it to?

**Persona:** For me, success is pretty concrete:

    One consistent login story → whether it's web, mobile, microservice, or partner, the auth flow looks the same. No more "special cases."

    Security sign-off → audits stop flagging static tokens, and the security team actually trusts our setup.

    Developer speed → teams can spin up a new service or integrate a new partner without weeks of custom auth glue. Ideally it's just "drop in the SDK, register the client, done."

    User experience → end users (internal or external) stop complaining about login weirdness or session timeouts. It just works.

    Partner confidence → when a partner says "we need OAuth 2.0 + PKCE," we can answer "yes" immediately without caveats.

In short: auth becomes invisible—it stops being the bottleneck and just quietly enables everything else.

Do you want me to lay out what failure would look like, so it's clear what risks we're trying to avoid?

---

## Step 5: User Identification

**AI:** Moving to Step 5.

Who's going to use this day-to-day, and what are they trying to get done?

**Persona:** Day-to-day users split into three buckets:

    Developers → they'll touch it most. They need to register new apps, get tokens, validate requests, and debug flows. Their goal is to build features without wrestling auth every time.

    End users (employees/customers/partners) → they just want seamless login: one password (or SSO), no confusing prompts, and predictable session behavior. Their goal is to get into the app and do their work without thinking about security plumbing.

    Security / IT admins → they'll oversee policies, manage identities, review logs. Their goal is to enforce compliance and catch anomalies without drowning in fragmented systems.

So: devs want speed, end users want simplicity, and admins want control/visibility.

Would it help if I rank which group will feel the biggest impact first once we roll this out?

---

## Step 6: Failure Scenarios

**AI:** Moving to Step 6.

What would make this project a disaster - what are you most worried about going wrong?

**Persona:** The nightmare scenarios look like this:

    Half-migration → we roll out a shiny new auth system, but legacy apps and services never get moved. Now we're maintaining two auth worlds forever, which is worse than today.

    Bad UX → if users suddenly get more logins, more prompts, or flaky SSO, they'll revolt. Security that feels harder always backfires.

    Integration blockers → partners or mobile apps discover the new system doesn't actually meet their spec (e.g., PKCE not fully implemented). That would tank trust fast.

    Security gaps → if we misconfigure token lifetimes, scopes, or key rotation, we might think we've solved auth but actually opened new holes.

    Developer slowdown → if the system is too rigid or complex, dev teams will route around it and keep bolting on exceptions.

So the big worry is ending up with extra complexity without real unification. That would make this project a net loss.

Do you want me to outline what guardrails we'd need in place to avoid those pitfalls?

---

## Step 7: Timeline & Urgency

**AI:** Moving to Step 7.

What deadlines or timing pressures are you dealing with - is there urgency around getting this done?

**Persona:** Yeah, there's definitely some urgency:

    Security audits → next formal review is in about 6 months. If we don't have a credible plan or progress by then, it'll get flagged again.

    Partner roadmap → we've got two integrations on the horizon (one this quarter, one early next) that both expect standard OAuth flows. If we're not ready, we'll burn time writing more throwaway adapters.

    Internal pressure → leadership wants fewer "IT exceptions" bogging down projects. Auth is a known sore spot, so they'd like to see movement this year.

So realistically, we need something tangible in place within 3–6 months. Not necessarily every legacy app migrated, but a unified platform stood up and proven on at least one partner integration.

Do you want me to talk through whether I'd prefer a big-bang cutover or an incremental rollout under those timelines?

---

## Step 8: Budget & Resources

**AI:** Moving to Step 8.

What's your budget reality - are we talking about a shoestring project or do you have real resources to throw at this?

**Persona:** We're not flush with unlimited budget, but this isn't a "nights-and-weekends hack" either.

    People → we've got a small security team, a couple of platform engineers, and dev teams that can adapt if the foundation is solid. We don't have headcount for a giant greenfield build.

    Money → there's room to license a serious IdP solution (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD B2C, etc.) if that accelerates us. Standing up our own from scratch would probably cost more in hidden engineering hours.

    Constraint → what we don't have is appetite for ongoing heavy ops cost. It needs to be maintainable without a dedicated squad babysitting it forever.

So: moderate budget, strong need for ROI, and preference for something proven we can adopt rather than invent.

Want me to outline where I'd invest first if the budget gets tight—like which capabilities are must-haves versus "nice later"?

---

## Step 9: Project Risks

**AI:** Moving to Step 9.

What could kill this project - what are the biggest risks or obstacles that might derail everything?

**Persona:** The biggest derailers I see:

    Legacy gravity → old apps tied to LDAP or custom auth may never get migrated. If they stay out of scope, we'll be stuck supporting the old mess.

    Organizational resistance → dev teams might push back if they see the new system as extra hoops, not a time-saver. Shadow auth patterns will creep back in.

    Partner demands shift → if a major partner suddenly requires SAML, OIDC, or some other protocol we didn't plan for, we could get blindsided.

    Budget creep → licensing an IdP or managed service could balloon costs if usage scales faster than expected.

    Execution risk → implementing incorrectly (misconfiguring token lifetimes, key rotation, etc.) could leave us less secure than before, even if it looks "modern."

So the project-killers are less about technology existing, and more about scope creep, adoption resistance, and misalignment with real-world needs.

Want me to prioritize which of these risks I'd attack first with mitigations, if we were drawing up a plan?

---

## Step 10: Success Metrics

**AI:** Moving to Step 10.

How will you measure if this is actually working - what metrics or signs will tell you it's a success?

**Persona:** I'd track it from three angles:

1. Security / compliance

   % of apps and services migrated off static tokens.

   Number of audit findings related to auth (should drop to zero).

   Token/key rotation logs showing consistent enforcement.

2. Developer productivity

   Time to onboard a new service or integration (goal: hours, not weeks).

   Number of custom auth adapters maintained (should steadily decline).

   Dev surveys / feedback on ease of use.

3. User / partner experience

   Support tickets about login/session issues (should trend down).

   Partner onboarding time (faster, fewer blockers).

   End-user login success rates / reduced churn on auth flows.

If we see those three trend lines moving in the right direction, then the "One Login, Everywhere" vision is delivering.

Do you want me to call out which single metric I'd elevate as the north star to rally everyone around?

---

## Step 11: Cost of Inaction

**AI:** Moving to Step 11.

What happens if you don't do this project - what's the cost of staying with what you have now?

**Persona:** If we stand still, the costs compound fast:

    Security exposure → static tokens and inconsistent auth will keep failing audits, leaving us open to real breaches. That risk alone could block deals or trigger penalties.

    Partner friction → every new integration means building yet another custom adapter. That burns weeks of dev time and makes us look unprofessional.

    Developer drag → teams keep wasting cycles on auth plumbing instead of building features. Morale takes a hit when "reinvent the login wheel" is the default.

    User pain → login quirks (timeouts, inconsistent sessions) erode trust. Worst case, customers churn because the system feels unreliable.

    Reputation hit → when security and UX both look weak, we lose credibility with partners, auditors, and leadership.

So the cost of doing nothing isn't just "status quo." It's growing security risk + slower delivery + worse user experience—a triple hit.

Want me to sketch what that looks like in dollar terms (lost dev hours, delayed deals), or keep it at the risk/impact level?

---

## Step 12: Decision Confidence

**AI:** Moving to Step 12.

What would make you confident this is the right solution - what would need to be true for you to feel good about moving forward?

**Persona:** For me to feel confident, a few things need to line up:

    Standards compliance → the solution must support OAuth 2.0, OIDC, PKCE, proper scopes/claims. No half-measures.

    Proven integration → I'd want to see it working cleanly with at least one legacy app, one mobile client, and one external partner before we call it "real."

    Security sign-off → the security team has to validate the flows, token handling, and key rotation as audit-ready.

    Developer adoption → it needs to be easier for devs to use the new system than to hack around it. Clear docs, SDKs, smooth onboarding.

    Migration path → there's a plan for pulling legacy apps in without endless re-writes.

If those conditions are met, I'd feel good that we're not just swapping one mess for another—we're building a foundation that lasts.

Would you like me to highlight which of these is the non-negotiable must-have versus which ones are strong preferences?

---

## Step 13: Missing Elements

**AI:** Moving to Step 13.

Last question - what haven't I asked that you think is important for understanding this project?

**Persona:** One thing we haven't really touched is governance—who owns this platform long-term.

If no one's accountable, it'll drift back into chaos. We need clarity on:

    Who manages client registrations (self-service vs. central approval).

    Who monitors logs and responds to auth-related incidents.

    Who drives ongoing upgrades (e.g., new standards like WebAuthn, passkeys).

The tech itself can be solid, but without ownership, it'll erode. That's as important as the architecture.

Want me to flag whether I see this living best under security, platform engineering, or some shared model?
