## Overall Assessment

### What Worked Well
- Kept things simple and clear.
- Questions flowed naturally without jargon.
- Allowed persona to express feelings of fear/confusion authentically.

### Major Issues
- Could have explored “look and feel” needs more (fonts, button size, accessibility).
- Missed chance to ask what tasks persona feels comfortable continuing without changes.

### Process Efficiency
- No frustration points for persona.
- Ownership clarity wasn’t discussed—who maintains Easy Work if issues arise?

### Business Value Alignment
- Yes - matched persona’s business need of reducing stress and errors in routine tasks.
- Would implement if real solution existed because of immediate personal benefit.

## Recommendations

- **Immediate fixes needed**: Add questions about accessibility and UI preferences (font size, icons, etc.).
- **Enhancements for next version**: Ask about trusted helpers (nephew, IT) earlier, as they are stakeholders.
- **Different personas to test**: Try Legacy User (#11) and Budget-Conscious User (#9).

## Feedback Template Assessment

## Overall Rating
