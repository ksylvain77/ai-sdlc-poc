## Overall Assessment

### What Worked Well

- Plain-language questions that matched my persona
- Logical sequence from pain points to goals to constraints
- Easy to stay in character without technical knowledge

### Major Issues

- Some areas (volume of invoices, document formats) were skipped

### Missing Elements

- Exact reporting needs for external accountant use

### Process Efficiency

- **Time investment?** Reasonable and proportional
- **Frustration points?** None significant
- **Ownership clarity?** Could have asked who maintains/updates the system

### Business Value Alignment

## Recommendations

- **Immediate fixes needed**: Ask about volume/scale of invoices and accountant’s reporting requirements
- **Enhancements for next version**: Explore integrations and backup/availability concerns more directly
- **Different personas to test**: Budget-Conscious User, Compliance-Obsessed User

## Overall Rating

- **Discovery Contract**: 4/5 stars — strong, but missed some context questions
- **Framework Contract**: N/A — not tested
