# Feedback - Pushback User - Invoice Rescue

## Test Session Overview

- **Persona Used**: Pushback User (Skeptical & Resistant)
- **Project Scenario**: Invoice Rescue (automation for complete data capture and validation)
- **Contracts Tested**: Discovery

## Discovery Contract Feedback

### Question Quality
- **Appropriate for persona?** Yes — questions stayed clear and avoided unnecessary technical jargon.
- **Clear and understandable?** Yes — questions were plain English and direct. None felt confusing.
- **Logical flow?** Yes — questions built step by step from problem to constraints naturally.
- **Missing questions?** Could have probed earlier on why past failures created skepticism, and what "proof of simplicity" would look like.

### Process Experience
- **Felt natural?** Yes — the back-and-forth allowed pushback without derailing.
- **Right amount of probing?** Just right — not too heavy, not too shallow.
- **Captured your needs accurately?** Yes — validation at source, no-training simplicity, plug-and-play requirement were captured.
- **Persona authenticity?** Strong — I could stay skeptical and resistant without being forced out of role.
- **Persona pressure?** No — questions respected resistance and redirected instead of fighting it.
- **Technical restraint?** Yes — I wasn’t forced to answer technical details.

### Contract Flexibility
- **Handled pushback well?** Yes — skepticism was acknowledged instead of dismissed.
- **Adapted to direction changes?** Yes — when I challenged, the process reframed questions effectively.
- **Assumptions made?** Minimal — didn’t assume too much about systems beyond asking what exists.
- **Missing context?** Governance politics could have been probed earlier, but was eventually addressed.

### Time and Efficiency
- **Duration reasonable?** Yes — 10 steps moved smoothly, not overly long.
- **Patience level?** Maintained throughout, not overloaded.
- **Integration exploration?** Light — accounting and IT mentioned, but integration depth left open.

## Framework Contract Feedback
_Not tested in this session._

## Overall Assessment

### What Worked Well
- Pushback and skepticism were handled without breaking flow.
- Clear capture of daily frustration (missing info chase).
- Constraints (no installs, no friction) nailed early.

### Major Issues
- Proof of simplicity / evidence of not repeating past failures wasn’t deeply explored.
- Political/organizational hurdles could use more emphasis.

### Missing Elements
- Examples of what “success pilot” would look like (metrics, scope of first rollout).
- More detail on how staff would actually adopt without resistance.

### Process Efficiency
- **Time investment?** Reasonable — concise and productive.
- **Frustration points?** None major — process felt tailored to persona.
- **Ownership clarity?** A bit vague — who runs/maintains the tool wasn’t clear.

### Business Value Alignment
- **Did final output match business needs?** Yes — focused on simplicity, validation, and time savings.
- **Would you actually implement this solution?** Yes, if proven lightweight and faster than email.

## Recommendations
- **Immediate fixes needed**: Add earlier exploration of “proof of simplicity” to overcome skepticism.
- **Enhancements for next version**: Push deeper on governance/politics and ownership of rollout.
- **Different personas to test**: Angry User, Budget-Conscious User, Legacy User.

## Overall Rating
- **Discovery Contract**: ★★★★☆ (4/5) — Strong flow, captured skepticism well, but could probe “proof” more.
- **Framework Contract**: N/A — not tested
- **Would recommend to others**: Yes — useful for surfacing resistant stakeholder needs.
