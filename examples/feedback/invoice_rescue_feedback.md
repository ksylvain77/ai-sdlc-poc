# Contract Testing Feedback

## Test Session Overview
- **Persona Used**: Business User  
- **Project Scenario**: Streamlining manual invoice processing (“Invoice Rescue”)  
- **Contracts Tested**: Discovery  

## Discovery Contract Feedback

### Question Quality
- **Appropriate for persona?** Yes – questions were phrased in plain English, easy to follow.  
- **Clear and understandable?** Yes – no jargon or technical language that would trip up a non-technical user.  
- **Logical flow?** Yes – questions built naturally from project naming → vision → inputs/outputs → daily use → deal-breakers → success criteria → business impact → stakeholders → technical considerations.  
- **Missing questions?** Slightly – it could have asked about budget expectations or tolerance for subscription vs. one-time cost, since ROI was important for the persona.  

### Process Experience
- **Felt natural?** Yes – the back-and-forth felt like a real discovery call.  
- **Right amount of probing?** Just right – it pushed me to clarify priorities without overwhelming me.  
- **Captured your needs accurately?** Yes – the end result clearly reflected the business owner’s frustrations, desired outcomes, and deal-breakers.  
- **Persona authenticity?** Yes – I was able to stay in character easily; the contract didn’t force technical details on me.

## Overall Assessment

### What Worked Well
- Questions were clear, business-friendly, and avoided technical jargon.  
- The sequence built a complete picture of needs without feeling forced.  
- The focus stayed on outcomes (time savings, fewer errors, cash flow visibility).  

### Major Issues
- Budget/cost expectations were never discussed.  
- No validation of integration needs (e.g., with accounting software) – could be critical.  
- Technical/storage/security questions came late; might be overwhelming if asked too early.  

### Missing Elements
- Explicit ROI framing (e.g., “How many hours saved = what dollar value to you?”).  
- A closing summary to confirm understanding of the business owner’s problem statement.  

### Business Value Alignment
- **Did final output match business needs?** Yes – it emphasized time savings, accuracy, and simplicity, which are exactly what the persona valued.  
- **Would you actually implement this solution?** Yes – if the final product delivered what was described, it would be worth it.  

## Recommendations
- **Immediate fixes needed**: Add at least one budget/ROI question; include a final recap step to confirm needs.  
- **Enhancements for next version**: Ask about integrations with existing tools (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.).  
- **Different personas to test**: Hybrid User (to capture both business goals and technical feasibility).  

## Overall Rating
- **Discovery Contract**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) – Strong, but missing budget and integration aspects.  
- **Framework Contract**: N/A (not tested).  
- **Would recommend to others**: Yes – it felt like a natural discovery session for a non-technical small business owner.
