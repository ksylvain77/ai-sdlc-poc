## Test Session Overview

- **Persona Used**: Demanding User (Complex Requirements)
- **Project Scenario**: Compliance Control Plane / Integration & Governance Layer for Salesforce, Workday, ERP, Legal, etc.
- **Contracts Tested**: Discovery

## Discovery Contract Feedback

### Question Quality
- **Appropriate for persona?** Yes – questions probed deeply into compliance, integration, and governance, matching the complex requirements.
- **Clear and understandable?** Yes – all questions were clear and avoided technical jargon unless relevant to persona’s domain.
- **Logical flow?** Yes – questions built naturally from pain points → day-to-day use → audit triggers → ROI → stakeholders → technical setup → timeline.
- **Missing questions?** Could have asked more about scalability (future integrations) and vendor risk management.

### Process Experience
- **Felt natural?** Yes – dialogue matched a real discovery session, no forced pivots.
- **Right amount of probing?** Just right – balanced between broad and detailed.
- **Captured your needs accurately?** Yes – especially compliance vs usability tradeoff.
- **Persona authenticity?** Yes – could stay in character throughout.
- **Persona pressure?** No – not pushed outside persona.
- **Technical restraint?** Yes – AI avoided over-engineering, kept to governance framing.

### Contract Flexibility
- **Handled pushback well?** Yes – respected ELMO signal and moved on smoothly.
- **Adapted to direction changes?** Yes – conversation adjusted to priorities (e.g., compliance-first sequencing).
- **Assumptions made?** Minimal – mostly clarified instead of assuming.
- **Missing context?** Could have dug more into cost caps, licensing models.

### Time and Efficiency
- **Duration reasonable?** Yes – in-depth but not meandering.
- **Patience level?** Never lost patience, conversation remained constructive.
- **Integration exploration?** Yes – core systems identified clearly.

## Overall Assessment

### What Worked Well
- Strong framing of problem as a compliance control plane.
- Smooth handling of compliance vs usability tension.
- Clear sequencing (compliance foundation → usability layer).

### Major Issues
- Didn’t fully explore cost governance / vendor procurement constraints.
- Limited exploration of how ongoing ownership (business vs IT vs legal) would be enforced post-implementation.

### Missing Elements
- Scalability to additional systems beyond initial scope.
- Vendor evaluation criteria (SaaS vs custom build).

### Process Efficiency
- **Time investment?** Reasonable for depth achieved.
- **Frustration points?** None major – process felt collaborative.
- **Ownership clarity?** Good in discussion, but final solution ownership model still fuzzy.

### Business Value Alignment
- **Did final output match business needs?** Yes – emphasis on audit readiness and governance aligned well.
- **Would you actually implement this solution?** Yes – phased, compliance-first rollout is realistic.

## Recommendations

- **Immediate fixes needed**: Ensure vendor/procurement and cost constraints are explored earlier.
- **Enhancements for next version**: Add structured exploration of scalability and ownership models.
- **Different personas to test**: Hybrid User, Compliance-Obsessed User.

## Overall Rating
- **Discovery Contract**: 4/5 stars – strong compliance framing, but missed some governance/cost angles.
- **Framework Contract**: Not tested.
- **Would recommend to others**: Yes – useful for compliance-driven discovery sessions.
