# Contract Testing Feedback

## Test Session Overview

- **Persona Used**: 8 - Super User (Power User/Expert)
- **Project Scenario**: Unified authentication system (“One Login, Everywhere”)
- **Contracts Tested**: Discovery only

## Discovery Contract Feedback

### Question Quality

- **Appropriate for persona?** Yes – questions let me dive into technical specifics while still framing business pain points.
- **Clear and understandable?** Yes – all questions were clear and mapped well to business context.
- **Logical flow?** Yes – built naturally from problem definition to risks and metrics.
- **Missing elements?** Governance/ownership was not asked until the very end (I raised it). Earlier probing here would have been valuable.

### Process Experience

- **Felt natural?** Yes – conversation stayed realistic for an expert user.  
- **Right amount of probing?** Just right – not repetitive, let me elaborate in detail.  
- **Captured your needs accurately?** Yes – security, developer productivity, and partner integration pain were surfaced.  
- **Persona authenticity?** Strong – I could comfortably roleplay as a domain expert.  
- **Persona pressure?** No – no push to step outside persona.  
- **Technical restraint?** Not needed – persona was expert-level, so technical answers were welcome.

### Contract Flexibility

- **Handled pushback well?** Yes – adapted when I offered risks and alternative views.  
- **Adapted to direction changes?** Yes – followed my pivots (security vs developer vs partner impact).  
- **Assumptions made?** Some assumption that we’d replace legacy systems outright; I clarified integration concerns.  
- **Missing context?** Governance/long-term ownership context was underexplored until I surfaced it.

### Time and Efficiency

- **Duration vs. value?** Reasonable – enough depth to surface real issues without dragging.  
- **Patience level?** No frustration – flow kept me engaged.  
- **Integration exploration?** Covered adequately – Azure AD, LDAP, partners, gateways noted.

## Framework Contract Feedback

N/A – not tested.

## Overall Assessment

### What Worked Well

- Clear structure and logical progression through discovery.  
- Questions allowed me to highlight both technical and business dimensions.  
- Space to articulate risks, success metrics, and stakeholder impacts.  

### Major Issues

- Governance/ownership wasn’t probed until I volunteered it.  
- Slight assumption toward “rip and replace” instead of hybrid migration reality.  

### Process Efficiency

- **Frustration points?** None.  
- **Ownership clarity?** Not fully addressed – needs explicit questioning.  

### Business Value Alignment

- **Did final output match business needs?** Yes – accurately surfaced need for unified, standards-based auth.  
- **Would you actually implement this solution?** Yes – provided clear justification and path forward.

## Recommendations

- **Immediate fixes needed**: Add explicit governance/ownership questions earlier.  
- **Enhancements for next version**: Probe migration vs. replacement tradeoffs more directly.  
- **Different personas to test**: Try Compliance-Obsessed (14) and Legacy User (11) for auth scenarios.

## Feedback Template Assessment

### Template Usability

- **Easy to fill out?** Yes – straightforward.  
- **Right level of detail?** Just right.  
- **Missing questions?** None critical, though might add a prompt on governance.  
- **Redundant questions?** None.  

### Template Completeness

- **Captured your experience adequately?** Yes – matched the flow well.  
- **Appropriate structure?** Yes – mirrored the discovery flow.  
- **Time to complete?** ~10 minutes – reasonable.

## Overall Rating

- **Discovery Contract**: ★★★★☆ (4/5) – strong structure, minor gaps on governance.  
- **Framework Contract**: N/A  
- **Would recommend to others**: Yes – useful structure for surfacing real requirements.
