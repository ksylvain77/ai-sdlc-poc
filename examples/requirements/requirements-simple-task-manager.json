{
  "project_name": "Simple Task Manager",
  "problem_statement": "I've been keeping track of my tasks in a messy Google Doc, and it's starting to get out of hand. I want something a little more structured — like a simple web tool where I can add tasks, mark them as done, and maybe tag them by project. Nothing super fancy, but easier to manage than a giant document.",
  "solution_summary": "Mostly tagging by project and being able to check them off. Due dates would be nice too, so I can see what's coming up soon, but I don't think I need anything heavy like Gantt charts or complex scheduling. Just a clean way to separate tasks by project and track what's done versus not done.",
  "data_inputs": "Task descriptions, project tags, due dates (optional)",
  "data_outputs": "Task lists organized by project, completion status, upcoming due dates",
  "processing_requirements": "Add/edit/delete tasks, mark tasks complete, filter by project, sort by due date, sync between devices",
  "user_interface": "Yeah, mainly through the browser on my laptop, but it'd be great if it worked on my phone too. I don't need a native mobile app, just something responsive that I can pull up in the browser when I'm away from my desk.",
  "frequency": "I'd be checking it daily. I usually have around 15–20 tasks going at any given time, spread across a couple of projects. I'd want to update it as I go, like adding new tasks or marking things complete during the day.",
  "complexity": "simple",
  "success_criteria": "I'll know it's working if I can quickly see all my tasks by project, add new ones without any hassle, and keep everything in sync between devices.",
  "constraints": "If it's slow or clunky, I'll stop using it — I need to be able to add or check off a task in just a couple of clicks. I also wouldn't want to deal with a bunch of required fields every time I add something; it should be lightweight. And if it doesn't sync properly between my laptop and phone browser, that would be a deal-breaker.",
  "deal_breakers": "Slow or clunky interface, bunch of required fields for adding tasks, doesn't sync properly between laptop and phone browser",
  "frustration_triggers": "If it's buggy — like tasks disappearing, not saving, or reminders not showing up — or if it starts adding too many features that make it feel bloated instead of simple."
