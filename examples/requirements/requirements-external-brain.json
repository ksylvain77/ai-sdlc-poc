  "project_name": "External Brain",
  "problem_statement": "Need something that remembers for me - a brain outside my brain that keeps track of all the little bits of information that pop into my head so I can stop carrying mental weight and stop letting people down when I forget things.",
  "current_state": "Information scattered across sticky notes, phone notes app, and trying to keep things in my head. No real system - just scattered pieces everywhere. Often can't remember where I put something (paper, phone, or never wrote it down at all) and waste time hunting or give up entirely.",
  "inspiration_context": "Building frustration over time, with a specific breaking point when lost someone's phone number that was written down somewhere and had to embarrassingly ask for it again. The 'ugh, I can't keep doing this' moment.",
  "stakeholders_involved": [
    "Primarily personal use - main user who needs brain-help most",
    "Family members - get frustrated when user forgets plans or details, think user wasn't paying attention",
    "Coworkers - have to remind user or waste time re-doing things when user forgets",
    "Potential future: family could add things directly instead of relying on user to remember"
  ],
  "data_flow": {
    "types": [
      "People's phone numbers and personal details",
      "Tasks and errands - follow-ups, random 'don't forget' items",
      "Dates and times - small appointments, when promised to call someone",
      "Ideas that pop up in the moment",
      "Passwords (though these need somewhere 'secure')",
      "Anything that pops into head that feels important in the moment but slips away if not caught"
    ],
    "volume": "20-30 things floating around by end of week, some days just a couple things, other days feels like juggling a dozen bits and pieces",
    "flow_pattern": "Constant stream of little bits of information throughout the day that need to be caught and retrieved later"
  },
  "existing_systems": {
    "primary_devices": "Phone (always with user), computer (when sitting at desk)",
    "current_tools": "Notes app sometimes, reminders app, but forgets to look at them so they don't help",
    "integration_preference": "Should definitely work with phone, uncertain about computer - worried about making it more confusing",
    "scattered_locations": "Sticky notes, phone notes, trying to keep in head"
  },
  "success_criteria": [
    "Brain can finally relax - no more mental weight from trying not to forget things",
    "Can trust that everything needed is in one place and can find it fast",
    "Replace panic ('where's that number?') with calm confidence",
    "Stop dropping the ball on life's little and not-so-little things"
  ],
  "users": {
    "primary_user": "Individual who needs memory assistance, trying to not drop balls on daily life tasks and commitments",
    "potential_family": "Could add things directly instead of relying on user to remember, but keeping it personal initially",
    "work_context": "Uncertain about coworker sharing - might get messy, so personal use first"
  },
  "failure_scenarios": [
    "Becomes another thing to keep track of - complicated steps to use it",
    "Turns into digital clutter - put stuff in but never find it again because it gets buried",
    "Doesn't stick - try for a week then abandon it like other apps",
    "Too fiddly - too many buttons or settings causing overwhelm",
    "Doesn't help right away - lose interest before it has chance to work",
    "Forces too much organization upfront - resists using if has to categorize everything perfectly"
  ],
  "timeline": {
    "urgency_level": "Sooner the better - every time something important gets lost it feels urgent in that moment",
    "pressure_source": "Personal desire to stop having little crises, no external deadlines",
    "motivation": "Ready to finally get a handle on scattered information"
  },
  "budget": {
    "preference": "Free would be ideal",
    "acceptable": "Small monthly cost if it actually works and really solves the problem",
    "limit": "Not huge amount, would bail if it gets into 'subscription overload' territory",
    "value_focus": "Cost justified only if it demonstrably works"
  },
  "risks": [
    "User not sticking with it - will slip back to old habits if feels like effort",
    "Too overwhelming - too many buttons/settings will cause abandonment",
    "Slow to show value - will lose interest if doesn't help immediately",
    "Complexity barrier - confusing or complicated interface leads to giving up"
  ],
  "success_metrics": [
    "Stop losing things that were written down",
    "People stop having to remind user of promised things",
    "Less 'oh no, I forgot' panic feeling",
    "No more random sticky notes everywhere",
    "Life feels smoother and can trust self more"
  ],
  "cost_of_inaction": [
    "More of the same - missed things, wasted time hunting for notes",
    "Continued embarrassment when forgetting stuff",
    "Ongoing stress and scattered feeling",
    "Mental load buzzing - brain always trying not to drop anything (exhausting)",
    "Continuing to let people down which user really doesn't want"
  ],
  "confidence_requirements": [
    "Really simple - can add something in two seconds without thinking",
    "Reliable - will still be there when needed, won't disappear or get lost in menus",
    "Easy to check - one place to look and instantly see what's needed",
    "Feels natural - not like a chore, more like a habit that fits into day"
  ],
  "additional_considerations": {
    "flexibility_need": "Shouldn't feel too formal - needs to handle both messy brain-dumps and organized stuff without forcing choice upfront. Sometimes just wants to jot something quick and messy, figure it out later."
