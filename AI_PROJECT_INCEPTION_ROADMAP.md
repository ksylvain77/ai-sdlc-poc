# AI SDLC Inception Template - Development Roadmap

## üéØ Vision

Create a reusable template that transforms ideas into ready-to-build software projects through structured AI contracts.

## üèóÔ∏è Template Architecture

```
User Idea ‚Üí Discovery Contract ‚Üí Framework Contract ‚Üí Complete Project Scaffold ‚Üí Ready to Build
```

---

## Phase 1: Discovery Contract ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Systematic requirements gathering through structured AI conversation

### What We Built:

- [x] **8-Step Discovery Process** - Structured conversation flow in `discovery_contract_full.md`
- [x] **Tech-Savvy Detection** - Automatically adapts conversation depth based on user sophistication
- [x] **Comprehensive Capture** - Problem statement, solution summary, constraints, success criteria
- [x] **JSON Output Format** - Structured requirements ready for Framework Contract consumption

### Validated Across:

- [x] Simple projects (PWA plant watering app)
- [x] Mobile applications (React Native medication tracker)
- [x] API services (Node.js bill reminder system)
- [x] Enterprise platforms (Customer-360 data fabric)

---

## Phase 2: Framework Contract ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Transform requirements into technology decisions and project scaffolds

### What We Built:

- [x] **7-Step Architecture Selection** - Systematic tech stack decision process in `framework_contract_full.md`
- [x] **Opinionated Recommendations** - Makes concrete technology choices with reasoning
- [x] **Complete Scaffolding** - Generates directory structure, starter code, configuration files
- [x] **Multi-Stack Support** - AI generates appropriate scaffolds for any technology stack

### Proven Outputs:

- [x] Node.js/Express API with Twilio integration
- [x] Event-driven Java microservices with Kafka
- [x] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [x] Database schemas and domain models
- [x] Configuration and setup instructions

---

## Phase 3: Contract Refinement üöß **IN PROGRESS**

**Goal**: Improve contract reliability and output quality based on AI feedback analysis

### Priority Improvements:

- [ ] **Stakeholder Prioritization** - Add explicit weighting system to Discovery Contract
- [ ] **Architectural Decision Records** - Track technology choice reasoning in Framework Contract
- [ ] **Business Metrics Integration** - Enhance success criteria beyond technical SLAs
- [ ] **Governance Considerations** - Address compliance, exceptions, operational oversight

### Template Usability:

- [x] **Comprehensive README** - Clear instructions for template usage
- [ ] **Setup Documentation** - Step-by-step guide for copying and using template
- [ ] **Example Walkthrough** - Complete example from idea to scaffold

---

## Phase 4: Template Distribution & Usage üìã **PLANNED**

**Goal**: Establish proper template repository patterns and user workflow

### Template Repository Setup:

- [ ] **GitHub Template Repository** - Configure repo as official GitHub template
- [ ] **Template Initialization** - Script to clean working directories for new projects
- [ ] **User Workflow Documentation** - Clear instructions for "Use this template" vs fork/clone
- [ ] **Gitignore Strategy** - Protect against accidental user content commits

### Distribution Standards:

- [ ] **Template Best Practices** - Follow established template repository patterns
- [ ] **Version Management** - Release versioning for template updates
- [ ] **Usage Analytics** - Track template adoption and usage patterns
- [ ] **Community Guidelines** - Instructions for template improvement contributions

---

## Success Criteria

### Template Effectiveness

- [x] **End-to-End Validation** - Complete pipeline from idea to buildable project
- [x] **Multi-Complexity Support** - Works for simple and enterprise-level projects
- [ ] **High Success Rate** - 90%+ of generated scaffolds work out-of-the-box
- [ ] **User Adoption** - Template copied and used by external developers
- [ ] **Clean Template Usage** - No accidental user content in template repository

---

## Current Status

**Phase 1 & 2**: ‚úÖ Complete and validated  
**Phase 3**: üöß In progress - contract refinement based on feedback  
**Phase 4**: üìã Planned - template distribution and usage patterns

## Template Philosophy

- **Inception Focus**: Gets projects started, doesn't build complete applications
- **Reusable Template**: Copy this template for any new project
- **AI-Driven Decisions**: Contracts guide AI to make appropriate technology choices
- **Simple & Focused**: Two contracts, get a scaffold, start building

---

_This template transforms the software project inception phase from ad-hoc conversations into systematic, repeatable processes that consistently produce high-quality starting points for development._
