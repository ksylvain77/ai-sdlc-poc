# Feedback on Unified Customer-360 Platform Conversation and Artifacts

## Overall Evaluation

The artifacts (project scaffold and requirements JSON) capture the
essence of the requirements conversation well. They show strong
alignment between business challenges, technical strategy, and
non-functional requirements. Both documents demonstrate rigor and an
attempt to operationalize the dialogue into actionable design elements.
However, there are gaps and opportunities for refinement to improve
clarity, prioritization, and stakeholder alignment.

## Strengths

-   The **requirements JSON** is structured and maps conversation points
    into clear fields: problem statement, solution summary, constraints,
    triggers, etc. This creates traceability from conversation to
    requirements.
-   The **project scaffold document** demonstrates architectural depth:
    event-driven fabric, regional compliance enforcement, integration
    connectors, and observability layers are explicitly laid out.
-   Strong emphasis on **non-functional requirements** like sub-2-second
    performance and scalability. These targets are concrete and
    testable.
-   Clear handling of **constraints and deal-breakers**: data residency,
    latency, avoidance of big-bang migration.

## Weaknesses and Gaps

-   **Stakeholder priorities** are captured but not weighted.
    Marketing's needs are treated equally to regulatory compliance,
    which in reality have different levels of criticality. Lack of
    prioritization risks design tradeoffs later.
-   **Architecture choices** (Kafka, Debezium, Kubernetes) are
    prescriptive early on. While they align with the conversation, the
    artifact doesn't highlight alternative paths or decision criteria.
-   **Governance and compliance** are framed as automated enforcement,
    but there's little detail on how exceptions or regional overrides
    would be handled. This may be a future failure mode.
-   The **directory scaffold** is highly technical and Java-centric. It
    assumes implementation details before confirming if Java is the
    enterprise standard stack for all regions. This could narrow
    flexibility prematurely.
-   **Success criteria** focus on latency and developer velocity, but
    omit measurable business outcomes (cost savings, regulatory incident
    reductions, user adoption metrics).
-   **Integration risks**: The mainframe CDC adapter is noted, but no
    fallback plan is detailed if CDC proves unreliable or unsupported.

## Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize requirements**: Rank stakeholder success definitions by
    criticality (e.g., compliance \> operations \> marketing) to guide
    tradeoffs.
2.  **Add architectural decision records**: Capture why
    Kafka/Debezium/K8s were chosen and what alternatives were
    considered. This provides resilience in case of vendor or regulatory
    changes.
3.  **Expand governance model**: Define how automated compliance
    integrates with human oversight, exception handling, and
    region-specific nuances.
4.  **Abstract implementation scaffold**: Keep language-agnostic
    placeholders (e.g., "customer-domain aggregate") rather than
    assuming Java for all components until tech stack alignment is
    complete.
5.  **Tie to business KPIs**: Include cost savings, audit outcomes, and
    staff efficiency metrics in success criteria alongside technical
    SLAs.
6.  **Mitigation strategies**: Add contingency plans for fragile
    integrations (mainframe log parsing, APAC vendor black box).

## Conclusion

The conversation and artifacts show a strong starting alignment and
capture the complexity of the problem space. The next iteration should
focus on balancing technical ambition with pragmatic stakeholder
priorities, adding decision transparency, and ensuring that success is
tied to measurable business impact as much as technical performance.
