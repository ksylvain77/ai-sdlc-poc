  "project_name": "Smart Medication Reminder System",
  "problem_statement": "User manages multiple prescriptions with different timing requirements, has been burned by unreliable reminder apps that either spam notifications or break when doses are missed, refill management is nightmare due to timing constraints with pharmacy/doctor availability",
  "solution_summary": "Intelligent medication tracking that handles missed doses gracefully, provides accurate refill warnings with real-world timing, and adapts to travel/schedule changes without breaking or nagging",
  "data_inputs": "Medication details (name, frequency, timing flexibility rules, refill lead times, travel preferences), dose confirmations, refill dates",
  "data_outputs": "Smart dose reminders, accurate refill warnings timed for pharmacy/doctor availability, travel-aware scheduling adjustments",
  "processing_requirements": "Track multiple medications with different timing rules, handle missed doses per medication type (late OK vs skip), calculate refill warnings based on real-world constraints, adapt to time zone changes selectively",
  "user_interface": "Simple one-time setup per medication (5 key fields max), non-intrusive reminders, easy dose confirmation, travel mode toggles",
  "frequency": "Multiple daily dose reminders, weekly refill checks, occasional travel adjustments",
  "complexity": "moderate",
  "success_criteria": "Zero missed refills due to timing, user trusts and follows all reminders, system adapts to real life without feeling broken or punitive",
  "constraints": "Setup must be completable for 6-7 meds in one sitting, refill warnings must account for pharmacy/doctor office hours and days, no false alarms that erode trust, must distinguish between take-late vs skip-dose medications, travel time zone handling must be user-controlled not automatic",
  "deal_breakers": "Nagging after missed doses, confusing missed dose handling that could cause double-dosing, false refill alarms, automatic time zone adjustments without user control, overwhelming setup process, making user feel like they broke the system when life happens"
