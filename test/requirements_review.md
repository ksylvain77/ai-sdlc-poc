Here’s an AI review pass on the three requirement documents, marking where they’re strong and where nuances from the conversations are missing:

---

## Smart Budget Guardrails (requirements-budget-guardrails.json)
**Strengths:**
- Captures problem of failed apps and desire for real-time warnings.
- 4 simple categories: rent, bills, groceries, everything else.
- Refuses bank linking, relies on manual entry.
- Instant green/red light purchase check.
- Proactive warnings at 85% usage.
- Success criteria emphasize not abandoning after a month and feeling like a guardrail.

**Missing nuances:**
- **Nag tuning:** Needs explicit rule about not spamming (e.g., cooldown between warnings).
- **Data staleness:** Weekly entry is acceptable; requirement should state tolerance for imperfect data.
- **Edge cases:** Mid-month budget edits, refunds, split transactions.

## Smart Recipe Organizer (requirements-smart-recipes.json)
**Strengths:**
- Problem of scattered recipes documented clearly.
- Ingredient-driven search prioritized.
- Both quick add and batch import supported.
- Pantry staples persist across sessions.
- Add-on suggestions included.
- Success criteria emphasize reducing food waste and real usage.

**Missing nuances:**
- **Ingredient normalization:** Synonyms (spring onion vs scallion) not addressed.
- **Frustration clause:** Could mention abandonment risk if it feels like just a filing cabinet.
- **Batch import quality:** No mention of error handling or user review of imports.

## Bill Reminder System (requirements-bill-reminder.json)
**Strengths:**
- Captures messy paper/email problem and monthly late fees.
- One-time setup for bills.
- Text reminders at 7 and 3 days.
- Skips second reminder if paid.
- Success criteria: no more late fees, easy for non-technical user.

**Missing nuances:**
- **Irregular bills:** Annual or one-off bills not mentioned.
- **Due date shifts:** No handling for weekends/holidays.
- **Marking paid:** Method of marking paid (SMS reply vs. UI) not captured.

## Overall Review
The requirement docs are clean captures of the conversations. They correctly document the **core problem, solution, inputs, outputs, UI, frequency, complexity, and success criteria.** Where they fall short is in **edge-case handling and frustration-based requirements.** For scaffolding, those missing nuances should be folded into rules and constraints, e.g.:
- Cooldown windows for proactive warnings (Budget).
- Synonym maps for ingredient recognition (Recipes).
- Holiday/weekend adjustments for due dates (Bills).

These refinements will make the decision engine outputs feel more resilient and user-trustworthy.
