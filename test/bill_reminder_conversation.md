# Bill Reminder System Conversation (Verbatim)

**AI:** Hi! I'm your AI Project Architect. I help turn ideas into working software projects.

What problem are you trying to solve? Tell me about it in plain English.

**User:** I keep all my household bills in a messy pile of paper and email receipts. Every month I forget at least one—like the electric bill or the internet bill—and then I get late fees. I'm not good with spreadsheets or anything technical.

I just want some way for the computer to keep track of the bills for me and remind me before they're due.

That's it.

**AI:** Got it - you want to stop forgetting bills and avoid those annoying late fees.

How do you usually pay your bills when you do remember them? Do you go online to each company's website, write checks, use your bank's app, or something else?

**User:** Mostly I go online to each company's website and pay with my debit card. A couple of them, like my rent and the water bill, I still write checks for and put in the mail. I don't really use my bank's app much except to check my balance.

**AI:** Makes sense - you've got your payment routine down, you just need help remembering when to do it.

How would you like to be reminded? Would you want something that pops up on your computer, sends you a text, an email, or maybe just shows you a list when you open something?

**User:** Honestly, texts would be the easiest for me. I always see those right away. Emails I tend to ignore, and pop-ups on the computer I might miss if I'm not sitting at it. A text that just says "Hey, your electric bill is due in 3 days" would be perfect.

**AI:** Perfect - texts are hard to ignore!

How far ahead would you want those reminders? Like do you want a heads up a week early, or just a few days before it's due?

**User:** A couple of nudges would help me most:

    7 days before (so I can plan around payday), and

    3 days before (so I actually do it).

If I've already paid, the second reminder can just skip.

**AI:** That's smart - gives you time to plan but also a final nudge to actually do it.

Last question: How would you want to tell the system about your bills initially? Would you rather just type in the basic info once (like "Electric bill, due 15th of each month"), or would you want something where you can somehow feed it those paper bills and emails you mentioned?

**User:** Typing it in once sounds fine. I don't need anything fancy. Just something like: electric bill due on the 15th, internet bill due on the 20th, rent due on the 1st. Then let the computer take it from there.

How far ahead would you want those reminders?

**User:** Two nudges: 7 days before, and 3 days before. Skip the second if I’ve already paid.

**AI:** Smart - plan ahead and final nudge. Last question: how would you tell the system about your bills?

**User:** Just type it once. Like: Electric bill due on the 15th, internet on the 20th, rent on the 1st. Then let the computer take it from there.
