Repeating download/fill/save/upload/email workflow where files get lost or saved in wrong places. Tabs and windows are confusing. Avoiding drag-and-drop, right-click menus, settings, spreadsheets, and updates out of fear. Printing and scanning causes stress. Writing steps on sticky notes to remember clicks. Process is slow and nerve-wracking with constant worry about losing work or breaking something.",
