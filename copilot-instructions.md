# Project Overview

This repository contains an AI SDLC Inception Template - a reusable template that transforms ideas into ready-to-build software projects through structured AI contracts. Users copy this template to start new projects, then execute two AI contracts (Discovery + Framework) to go from "I have an idea" to "I'm ready to build" with a complete project scaffold.

```## Libraries and Frameworks

This template doesn't use specific libraries - the AI executing the contracts generates appropriate technology stacks based on requirements. Proven to work with Node.js/Express, Java/Kafka/Kubernetes, React Native, and other stacks as determined by the AI during contract execution.

## Coding Standards

1. **Template Focus**: This is a template for project inception, not a complex system
2. **Contract Refinement**: Focus on improving the two core contracts based on feedback
3. **Simple & Focused**: Two contracts, get a scaffold, start building
4. **Don't expand scope**: No additional systems, just improve what we have
5. **Validate changes**: Test contract improvements with real examples
6. **Document clearly**: Keep README and roadmap aligned with actual capabilities
7. **Template maintenance**: Focus on making contracts more reliable and usable
8. **AI-driven decisions**: Contracts guide AI to make appropriate technology choices
9. **When editing contracts, test with examples to ensure they still work**
10. **Keep contracts focused on inception phase only**

## Build and Development

- This is a template repository - users copy it to start new projects
- Use Git branches for contract refinements (currently on phase-3/contract-refinement)
- Test contract changes with real examples across complexity levels
- Merge improvements back to main when validated
- Focus on contract reliability and output quality

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- Update roadmap to reflect completed contract improvements
- Follow the 3-phase approach: Discovery âœ…, Framework âœ…, Refinement ðŸš§
- Prioritize contract reliability over feature expansion
- Test improvements against proven examples (PWA, mobile, API, enterprise)
- Keep scope focused on project inception template
