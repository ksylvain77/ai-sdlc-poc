# Project Overview

This repository contains an AI Project Inception System that discovers user requirements through intelligent conversation, makes technology decisions based on those requirements, and generates complete software projects with automated SDLC setup. The system transforms user problems into working, deployable projects through a pipeline of AI Discovery → Technology Decision → Project Generation → SDLC Automation.

## Folder Structure

TBD - Structure will be determined as we build out the MVP components

## Libraries and Frameworks

Technology choices will be determined by the AI system based on user requirements and project needs. The system will support multiple languages and frameworks including Python, Node.js, Java, Go, and others as specified in the roadmap.

## Coding Standards

1. **Don't make assumptions about technology choices - ask first**
2. **Don't assume project scope - ask what should be included in the MVP**
3. **Start with the simplest version that works before adding complexity**
4. **ALWAYS ask specific clarifying questions instead of making broad assumptions**
5. **Build one working piece at a time, don't try to implement everything at once**
6. **For long-running commands (servers, watch processes): use `> /dev/null 2>&1 &` with `isBackground=false` to background without opening new terminals**
7. **Don't generate large amounts of code without confirming the approach first**
8. **When editing files, read the existing content first to understand context before making changes**
9. **When user references previous decisions, ask for specific confirmation before proceeding**
10. **Never create multiple files without explicit approval of each one**
11. **Never substitute different deliverables than what was explicitly decided - only create what was agreed upon**

## Build and Development

- Use standard Git best practices with automated workflows
- Create feature branches for each section of work (following the roadmap phases)
- Merge branches as features are completed
- Build and test processes will be determined based on the technologies chosen by the AI system
- Focus on MVP functionality first, then iterate

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- Update the roadmap to reflect completed work and next steps before merging each feature branch
- Follow the 5-phase development approach outlined in the roadmap
- Prioritize MVP features over advanced functionality
- The goal is proving the concept works, not building production software
