- **Implementation Completed**:
  - Added Step 9: "Ongoing Ownership & Support" to Discovery Contract
  - Adaptive questioning based on user context (individual, small business, enterprise)
  - Captures ownership_model, maintenance_preferences, support_expectations, governance_requirements
  - Addresses "after we build it" planning that was consistently missing
  - Prevents post-launch ownership confusion and support gaps
- **Affected Contracts**: Discovery Contract ✅
- **Date Completed**: August 31, 2025

### MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY (Essential Enhancements)

- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

#### 5. Improve Accessibility & UI Preference Discovery ⭐⭐⭐⭐

- **Impact**: Critical for user adoption, especially for non-technical personas
- **Implementation**: Accessibility requirements, UI preferences, simplicity validation
- **Estimated Effort**: Low-Medium

#### 6. Add Volume/Scale Questions ⭐⭐⭐⭐

- **Impact**: Affects architecture decisions and performance requirements
- **Implementation**: Transaction volumes, data scales, user counts, peak usage
- **Estimated Effort**: Low

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Process Improvements)

#### 7. Enhance Stakeholder Prioritization & Requirements Ranking ⭐⭐⭐

- **Implementation**: Stakeholder influence mapping, requirement criticality scoring
- **Estimated Effort**: High

#### 8. Improve Governance & Exception Handling Discovery ⭐⭐⭐

- **Implementation**: Exception processes, override mechanisms, compliance workflows
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

#### 9. Add Environment Context Questions ⭐⭐⭐

- **Implementation**: Deployment environment, usage context, device constraints
- **Estimated Effort**: Low

### LOWER PRIORITY (Quality of Life Improvements)

#### 10. Add Final Recap/Confirmation Step ⭐⭐

- **Implementation**: Requirements summary and stakeholder confirmation
- **Estimated Effort**: Low

#### 11. Improve Architectural Decision Transparency ⭐⭐

- **Implementation**: Decision rationale capture, alternatives documentation
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

#### 12. Enhance Business KPI Integration ⭐⭐

- **Implementation**: Success metrics alignment, business outcome tracking
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Gaps (Items 1-3)

**Timeline**: Immediate (Sprint 1-2)
**Focus**: Address the most frequently mentioned and business-critical gaps
**Deliverables**: Updated Discovery Contract with budget, integration, and ownership questions

### Phase 2: User Experience (Items 4-6)

**Timeline**: Short-term (Sprint 3-4)
**Focus**: Improve user adoption and technical feasibility discovery
**Deliverables**: Enhanced Discovery Contract with scalability and accessibility coverage

### Phase 3: Process Maturity (Items 7-9)

**Timeline**: Medium-term (Sprint 5-8)
**Focus**: Sophisticated prioritization and governance capabilities
**Deliverables**: Advanced Discovery Contract features, Framework Contract enhancements

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Items 10-12)

**Timeline**: Long-term (Sprint 9+)
**Focus**: Quality of life improvements and advanced features
**Deliverables**: Comprehensive contract suite with full traceability

## Key Insights

1. **Budget/cost questions are universally missing** - This is the highest-impact, most frequently mentioned gap
2. **Integration discovery is consistently shallow** - Technical feasibility depends heavily on existing system landscape
3. **Post-implementation planning is an afterthought** - Ownership and maintenance planning should be upfront
4. **Different personas reveal different blind spots** - Multi-persona testing approach is validated and should continue
5. **Contracts work well for basic discovery** - Foundation is solid, needs depth in practical concerns

## Success Metrics

- **Feedback Score Improvement**: Target 4.5+/5.0 average rating across all contracts
- **Implementation Success Rate**: Reduce post-discovery scope changes by 50%
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Achieve 90%+ "would recommend" rating
- **Coverage Completeness**: Address 100% of High Priority gaps, 80% of Medium-High Priority gaps

## Next Steps

1. **Review and prioritize** this analysis with the development team
2. **Create detailed implementation specs** for Phase 1 items
3. **Update contract testing protocols** to validate improvements
4. **Establish feedback collection cadence** for ongoing refinement
